# Interview Transcript: z/OS Management Facility Usage in a Leading South American Bank

**Interviewer (I):** Thank you for joining me today. Could you start by telling me about your role at the bank and your experience with z/OS Management Facility?

**Respondent (R):** Claro que sí. Oh, excuse me - of course. I'm a Senior System Programmer at one of the largest banks in South America. I've been with the bank for 15 years and have been using z/OS Management Facility, or z/OSMF as we call it, for about 6 years now.

**I:** Thank you. Could you tell me more about how you use z/OSMF in your day-to-day work, particularly for software installation and configuration?

**R:** Certainly. Our bank has been growing rapidly, expanding across several countries in South America. This growth has made managing our mainframe environment more complex. We use z/OSMF extensively for software management, system monitoring, and configuration across our distributed mainframe environment.

For software installation, z/OSMF has been a game-changer. Before, we had to manage installations separately for each country's systems. Now, we can coordinate installations across all our systems from a single interface.

**I:** That sounds efficient. Could you walk me through a typical software installation process using z/OSMF?

**R:** Of course. Let's say we need to update our core banking software. First, I log into z/OSMF and go to the Software Management task. I create a new deployment, specifying the software package and the target systems.

What's unique in our case is that we need to consider different regulatory requirements for each country we operate in. So, we've customized our z/OSMF workflows to include country-specific configuration steps.

**I:** That's interesting. How do you manage these country-specific requirements within z/OSMF?

**R:** We've created separate workflows for each country. These workflows include steps to adjust system parameters, update security settings, and modify configuration files to comply with local regulations.

For example, in Brazil, we have additional steps to ensure compliance with the LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados). In Argentina, we have specific requirements related to the Financial Information Unit (UIF) for anti-money laundering.

z/OSMF allows us to package these country-specific steps into reusable workflows, which has greatly reduced errors and improved our compliance posture.

**I:** How has z/OSMF helped you manage the challenges of operating across multiple countries?

**R:** It's been invaluable. One of our biggest challenges was maintaining consistency across our systems in different countries while also adhering to local requirements. z/OSMF has allowed us to standardize our processes while still accommodating local variations.

Another challenge we faced was the time zone differences. We operate across multiple time zones, which used to make coordinating maintenance windows tricky. With z/OSMF, we can schedule and automate many tasks, which has made it much easier to manage these timing issues.

**I:** That's fascinating. Are there any specific features of z/OSMF that you find particularly useful in your context?

**R:** Sí, definitely. The REST API services have been a game-changer for us. We've developed some custom applications that interact with z/OSMF, allowing us to integrate mainframe management into our broader IT operations.

For instance, we've created a dashboard that pulls data from z/OSMF to give our management team real-time insights into system performance across all our countries. This has been crucial for capacity planning as we continue to expand.

Also, the Incident Log feature has been very useful. In a multi-country operation like ours, it helps us track and correlate issues across different systems, which has significantly improved our problem resolution times.

**I:** How do you handle language differences when using z/OSMF across different countries?

**R:** That's a great question. While most of our technical staff are proficient in English, we've made efforts to localize some aspects of our z/OSMF usage. We've customized some of the workflows to include instructions in Spanish and Portuguese, which has helped reduce errors and improve adoption among our local teams.

However, we do sometimes face challenges with technical terminology that doesn't always translate well. In those cases, we maintain a glossary of terms to ensure consistency across our teams.

**I:** Are there any challenges you face when using z/OSMF in your South American banking environment?

**R:** Yes, we've had our share of challenges. One of the main issues we face is related to network connectivity. Internet infrastructure can be inconsistent in some of the regions we operate in, which can sometimes make remote acc
